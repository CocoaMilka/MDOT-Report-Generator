## Background

ARBI is an AR bridge inspection software for the Hololens 2, developed by the INSPIRE research team at Missouri S&T. The software allows users to perform bridge inspections in AR.  This data is then saved into a .json file which this webpage is designed to read and fill out according to the MoDOT standard.
